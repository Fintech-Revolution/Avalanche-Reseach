# Avalanche-Reseach

## What is Avalanche?

Avalanche (AVAX) is a smart contract-capable blockchain platform focused on transaction speed, low costs, and eco-friendliness. Ultimately, what Avalanche hopes to deliver is a highly scalable blockchain that doesn’t sacrifice decentralization or security. Avalanche’s core innovation is it’s composed of three blockchains rather than the usual one. The reason behind this design choice is quite brilliant: Each blockchain specializes in a task within the broader Avalanche ecosystem instead of having one chain do them all. 

## What are the costs of using Avalanche?

Gas fees on Avalanche could range from 0.001 AVAX for transactions or up to 1 AVAX for other commiting other actions on the blockchain like creating a Subnet or a blockchain

## What about its infrastructure and capabilities?

The DAG-optimized consensus protocol–high-throughput model of Avalanche reportedly can process 4,500 transactions per second. One subnet could reach speeds of more than 4500 tps and the network has no limit for number of subnets  

## What about developing on Avalanche?

Avalanche allows for creation of tailor-made blockchains for different purposes which means that developers can implement any custom VM, make their blockchains permissionless or permissioned and decide what consensus mechanism to use. Being Solidity compatible also means all existing tools from Ethereum are available to Avalanche developers. Only requirement for subnets is to participate in securing the core platform. Currently there are 14 projects being built on Avalanche.

## What about Avalanche's Community?

With AVAX being one of the top 10 coins by market cap, a lot of people has being actively involved in the Avalanche community. They have a strong social presence on platforms like Twitter (600K followers) and Reddit (35K followers).


## What about Avalanche's Future?

Avalanche already has a strong foundation and its team is constantly improving the system. Its unique infrastructure has shown that fast speeds and low transaction fees are possible without sacrificing security. Adoption of the network is likely to make it one of the most appreciated blockchain-based projects of its kind.

## Pros and Cons

Pros:

- High speed and scalable for DApps
- Throughput is high and efficient without risking decentralization
- Huge institutional inflows have been attracted. Up to 25 million investment inflow a week (depends  but good signal) 
- Change rules for different subnets
- Avalanche consensus combines the benefits of Nakamoto consensus (robustness, scale, decentralization) and all the benefits of Classical consensus (speed, quick finality, and energy efficiency) without the disadvantages

Cons:
- Transactions may be delayed if validators are not in agreement on the status


## Conclusion

Avalanche addresses the need for financial services, blockchain environments with custom rules, and applications, while solving the problem of scalability that Ethereum users face with Dapp development. Avalanche offers all the dev tools available on the Ethereum network, is compatible with the EVM, and provides scalability, flexibility, and decentralized governance for all users.
